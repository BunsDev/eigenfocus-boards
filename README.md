# Our Vision
We're building an All-In-One Self-Hosted solution to manage projects, time and teams.

We've been working with product development for more than a decade so this product is built on the wisdom, pain and scars that we've gathered over the years. Our philosophy is to create a tool that is both simple and versatile: effective for projects of all sizes, from solo projects to multi-member teams.

Any new ideas are welcome.

# FREE EDITION (this repo)
## FREE EDITION - Features
Here are some of our current features:

- Projects: create/edit/update/archive you projects
- Boards: each project has a board where you can customize columns to your workflow
- Issues: create issues, write markdown descriptions and attach files
- Workflow with Boards: Move issues between columns
- Time Tracking: track time spent on a Project and a Specific Issue
- Time Report: generate time reports by project and time periods
- Themes: customize the UI to your taste

## FREE EDITION - Roadmap

Here is what is coming next:
- Seamless Integration between Boards <> Time Tracking
- Managing Logged Time Inside a Issue
- UX enhancements for handling multiple cards/issues at once in a board
- View Issues as List
- Long running time tracking alerts
- Timers and time alerts to improve focus (Pomodoro, drinking water, stretching)
- Focus playlist sounds/songs

# Installation
You can run our project using our docker image directly with docker or docker compose:

## Docker
```sh
docker run \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -v ./app-data:/eigenfocus-app/app-data \
    -p 3001:3000 \
    -e DEFAULT_HOST_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
    -d \
    eigenfocus/eigenfocus:0.7.0
```

And access it at http://localhost:3001.

## Docker Compose
Or using a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: eigenfocus/eigenfocus:0.7.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./app-data:/eigenfocus-app/app-data
    environment:
     - DEFAULT_HOST_URL=http://localhost:3001
    ports:
      - 3001:3000
```

Then, run it with the CLI:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

And access it at http://localhost:3001.

## Environment Configurations

- `DEFAULT_HOST_URL`: URL that is going to be used to access your application.
  - Example: "http://localhost:3001", "http://mydomain.com" or "https://mydomain.com"
- `FORCE_SSL`: Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, all incoming requests that are not HTTPS will be redirected to use HTTPS protocol.
- `ASSUME_SSL_REVERSE_PROXY`: Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, all incoming requests will be interpreted as HTTPS. This is useful for cases when you have `FORCE_SSL` set to `true` but are behind a reverse proxy that terminates the SSL. This means that our app will be receiving requests via HTTP. In order to avoid an infinite redirect loop to HTTPS you must set `ASSUME_SSL_REVERSE_PROXY` to `true`. For more information, check the conversation and changelog on https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47139.
